# Statistical Data Analysis Project

This project was completed as part of the *Statistical Data Analysis* course at college.

Developed in RStudio, the project explores a dataset of Netflix films and applies a range of statistical techniques, such as ANOVA, t-tests, Lilliefors test, linear regression and other statistical tools, to answer various questions and provide meaningful insights into the data.
