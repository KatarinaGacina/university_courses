# Cryptography and Cryptoanalysis

This laboratory assigement was completed as part of the *Cryptography and Cryptoanalysis* course at college. It is implemented in Python.

The goal of the laboratory assigement was to implement a secure chat client based on end-to-end encryption (E2EE) using a variant of the Double Ratchet algorithm. 
Before starting the Double Ratchet protocol, participants must authenticate each other via a server and establish a shared key using the Extended Triple Diffie-Hellman (X3DH) protocol. 
Additionally, the chat client is under a surveillance.
